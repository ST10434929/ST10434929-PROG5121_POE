Overview on Part 1: 

This Java application is a basic user authentication system created as part of a practical assessment. It demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as classes, methods, encapsulation, and input validation using conditionals and regular expressions. 

 

User Registration: 

User registration system checks that username contains an underscore while remaining less than 5 characters. 

The system requires passwords to meet criteria of eight characters with one capital letter and one number and one special character. 

The system validates South African cell phone numbers which must begin with +27 followed by 9 digits. 

 

User Login: 

The code verifies login access using available stored credentials to provide proper response messages. 

 A proper response with success or failure messages appears after validation.
